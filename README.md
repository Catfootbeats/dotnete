# dotnete
A simple video encoding, transcoding tool. Built on the top of Avalonia UI.

Imitates the [ELAINA](https://github.com/yukinsnow/ELAINA) with dotnet and Avalonia UI. So it names dotnete.

There is so many bugs. But I am lazy to fix them.(￣y▽,￣)╭ 

There is also many grammar problems in README. My english is so bad.
